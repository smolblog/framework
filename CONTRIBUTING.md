## About Pull Requests

Pull request templates are coming soon, but the basic idea is

1. Run the fixer. Use your IDE or `composer lintfix`.
2. Run the linter. Use your IDE or `composer lint`.
3. Write tests for new code.
4. Make sure tests for existing code pass. Only change those tests if there is a change in those classes, and then very carefully. Use `composer test`.
